# Credit Risk Assessment
The project presents a creditworthiness assessment for European companies spanning the years 2015 to 2020. Through the application of advanced predictive modeling techniques, our aim is to meticulously analyze the multifaceted factors influencing credit risk levels, encompassing turnover, EBIT, PLTax, and more.
